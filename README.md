# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-JavaScript-yellow.svg)

Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects repository! This repository contains five JavaScript projects that cover a range of algorithms and data structures. Each project is designed to help you enhance your programming skills and understanding of JavaScript.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Palindrome Checker**
   - A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. In this project, you'll implement a function that checks whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome.

2. **Roman Numeral Converter**
   - Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome. In this project, you'll create a function that converts a given number into its corresponding Roman numeral representation.

3. **Caesars Cipher**
   - The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Your task in this project is to implement a function that decrypts a given Caesar ciphered message.

4. **Telephone Number Validator**
   - In this project, you'll build a function that validates whether a given string represents a valid US phone number. The function will check the format and ensure it adheres to the standard US phone number rules.

5. **Cash Register**
   - The cash register project involves creating a function that takes a purchase price and cash payment and calculates the change due while minimizing the number of coins and bills used. It will also handle cases where exact change cannot be given.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project directory you want to explore:

   ```
   cd your-repository/Project-Name
   ```

3. Read the project's `README.md` file for detailed information on the project and how to run the JavaScript code.
